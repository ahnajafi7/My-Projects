# Titanic Dataset Analysis Report

## Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics, survival rates, and class distinctions. Through data manipulation and visualization, valuable insights into factors influencing survival are achieved.

## Objectives
1. Clean the Titanic dataset.
2. Perform descriptive statistics and data aggregation to understand demographics and survival rates.
3. Visualize data to highlight key patterns and insights.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Loaded the Titanic dataset and renamed columns for better readability.

## Descriptive Statistics
- Calculated average age, identified the oldest and youngest passengers, and grouped data by class and survival status.
- Determined the total number of survivors and counted survivors by class.

## Data Visualization
- **Pie Chart:** Shows most passengers were in third class.
- **Histogram:** Indicates a significant number of passengers were between 20 and 40 years old.

## Key Findings
1. **Demographics:** Most passengers were in third class with a wide age range.
2. **Survival Rates:** Higher survival rates in first class compared to third class.
3. **Age Factor:** Younger passengers in third class had lower survival rates.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into passenger demographics and survival patterns, which can be used for advanced analyses such as predictive modeling.

## Next Steps
1. **Advanced Survival Analysis:** Use statistical methods for detailed analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to enhance predictive modeling.
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Develop machine learning models to predict survival.
4. **Further Investigations:** Explore the impact of fare, embarkation point, and family size on survival rates.
5. **Historical Comparison:** Compare findings with other records for additional insights.
