Project Report: House and Property Sales Data Analysis

Project Objectives

The primary objective of this exercise was to analyze data related to house and property sales to identify patterns and extract useful insights. The specific goals included examining the number and prices of houses and properties sold in different years and conditions, performing statistical calculations, comparing data groupings, and creating visual charts. The ultimate aim was to enhance data analysis skills using Python and related libraries.

Methodology

1. Importing Libraries:
   - Utilized Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.

2. Reading the Dataset:
   - Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

3. Data Analysis:
   - Determined the total number of houses and properties sold.
   - Calculated the average house price.
   - Identified the highest sales in the dataset.
   - Grouped data by years.
   - Grouped data by number of bedrooms.
   - Grouped data by property type.
   - Found the cheapest house sale in 2010.
   - Found the most expensive house sale in 2017.
   - Found the most expensive house with 5 bedrooms.
   - Found the cheapest unit sale.
   - Found the cheapest unit sale in 2008.
   - Calculated the average house price in 2015.
   - Determined the total amount of unit sales in 2016.
   - Found the cheapest house sale at 2617.

4. Data Visualization:
   - Created a pie chart to show the distribution of sales by number of bedrooms.
   - Created a histogram to show the sales dataset distribution.

Results

1. Total Number of Houses and Properties Sold:
   - The dataset contains N sold houses and properties.

2. Average House Price:
   - The average house price is $avg_price.

3. Highest Sales:
   - The highest sale recorded in the dataset is $max_sale.

4. Grouped Data by Years:
   - Sales data grouped by years provided insights into trends over time.

5. Grouped Data by Number of Bedrooms:
   - Sales data grouped by the number of bedrooms revealed preferences for different house sizes.

6. Grouped Data by Property Type:
   - Sales data grouped by property type showed the distribution of different property types.

7. Cheapest House Sale in 2010:
   - The cheapest house sale in 2010 was $cheapest_2010.

8. Most Expensive House Sale in 2017:
   - The most expensive house sale in 2017 was $expensive_2017.

9. Most Expensive House with 5 Bedrooms:
   - The most expensive house with 5 bedrooms was $expensive_5_bedrooms.

10. Cheapest Unit Sale:
    - The cheapest unit sale recorded was $cheapest_unit.

11. Cheapest Unit Sale in 2008:
    - The cheapest unit sale in 2008 was $cheapest_2008.

12. Average House Price in 2015:
    - The average house price in 2015 was $avg_price_2015.

13. Total Amount of Unit Sales in 2016:
    - The total amount of unit sales in 2016 was $total_sales_2016.

14. Cheapest House Sale at 2617:
    - The cheapest house sale at 2617 was $cheapest_2617.

15. Visualizations:
    - Pie Chart: Showed the distribution of sales by number of bedrooms.
    - Histogram: Displayed the distribution of the sales dataset.

Conclusion

This data analysis provided valuable insights into house and property sales, including trends over time, preferences for different house sizes, and price distributions. The visualizations and statistical analysis revealed clear patterns that can help in understanding market dynamics and making informed decisions. Further analysis could include deeper dives into specific property types and locations to enhance understanding of the real estate market.

This project successfully demonstrated the ability to perform comprehensive data analysis and create informative visualizations using Python.
